# This workflow runs benchmarks against the current branch, compares them to benchmarks against
# main, and uploads the results as an artifact. Unlike in the Validate workflow we only test these
# benchmarks against the latest versions of Go and the Runner.

# This workflow could be improved by only running on pull requests and then posting the results back
# as a comment in the pull request.
